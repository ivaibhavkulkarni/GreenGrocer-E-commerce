## Description:
GreenGrocer is an intuitive, user-friendly e-commerce web app designed to make shopping for organic produce and plants easier and more enjoyable. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and NextAuth, the platform offers a seamless experience for users to purchase a wide range of organic products, including fruits, vegetables, water plants, indoor and outdoor plants, as well as seeds for plants and vegetables. The website features a clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI, ensuring a visually appealing and smooth shopping experience across all devices.

GreenGrocer simplifies the way users shop for healthy, fresh produce by providing detailed product information, secure payment processing through Stripe, and the convenience of easy browsing and quick checkouts. Whether you're a gardening enthusiast or simply seeking organic, eco-friendly products, GreenGrocer caters to your needs while fostering a healthier lifestyle.

In the next phase of the project, I plan to develop a native iOS mobile version of GreenGrocer. This will provide a more personalized and convenient shopping experience on mobile devices. Users will be able to browse, shop, and track their orders with ease, while also receiving push notifications. The mobile version will make accessing fresh, organic products even more convenient, ensuring a seamless transition between desktop and mobile experiences.

- Mobile Accessibility: With the upcoming iOS app, users will have access to the platform on-the-go, with features like push notifications, making it even easier to shop for organic products from anywhere.
